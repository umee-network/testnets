# Testnets

A collection of genesis transactions and other miscellaneous information
relevant to Umee test networks. Note, to find genesis files and peers for **active**

To submit a genesis transaction (gentx) for a network, please open a pull request
against the `main` branch of this repository into the relevant network under the
`networks/` directory.
