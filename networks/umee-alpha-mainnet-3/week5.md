# Week 5 of Umee Gravity Wars Testnet
### 18.01 12:01 UTC — 25.01 15:00 UTC

## Tasks
### Task 1
#### Accumulate as much voting power as possible
Test and analyze points of failure, opportunities, and other validators, free reign attack other validators, search for misconfigured validator setups and censor them from accumulating stake

### Task 2
### ⚠️ Make sure you use your second set of wallets (different from your validator and orchestrator wallets) to send the required amount of transactions.
#### Run the Most Profitable Bridge Relayer: Test our bridge implementation in a “real world setup” (Umee and ETH have an arbitrary value)
* Bridge relayers can set customized economic factors if they choose to and monitor bridge transaction requests.
* Relayers need to make the most fees from relaying transactions across blockchains while covering the network fees from the bridged blockchains.
* Umee will set up an exchange rate table for uUMEE and USDT and change the rate randomly throughout the day/week.
* Validators can choose to set a customized profit multiplier for what they would consider profitable (**batchFees >= txGasCost*profitMultiplier**).
* Each validator will need to send a minimum number of successful bridge transactions during the set time.
  * **Minimum per day: 200 successful transactions Umee-ETH and 200 ETH-Umee**
  * **Maximum per day: 1,000 successful transactions Umee-ETH and 1,000 ETH-Umee**
* P&Ls of the validators are calculated and the ones with the highest value get the highest points.
* Please note:
  * We will start counting a validator’s profit and loss from block height **TBA**
  * We will only be counting your profit and loss on your **orchestrator address (relayer transactions)**; any other transaction fees occurred outside of your orchestrator address will **NOT** be counted
  * Make sure you use your **second set of wallets (different from your validator and orchestrator wallets)** to send the required amount of transactions

### Task 3
#### Send Umee tokens to the Juno network via IBC module
 * Follow [github instructions](https://github.com/umee-network/testnets/blob/main/networks/umee-alpha-mainnet-3/IBC.md) as a starter
 * Send Umee tokens to Juno network and Juno tokens to Umee network
 * Submit:
   * **Juno** wallet which you sent **Umee** tokens to
   * **Umee** wallet which you sent **Juno** tokens to
   * **HASH** of transfer txs from **Umee** to **Juno** chain
   * **HASH** of transfer txs from **Juno** to **Umee** chain
 * Submit HASH of transfer txs to and from Umee chain

## How to set the multiplier?
### Set the multiplier
1. Open your `peggod` service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/peggod.service
```
2. Add `--profit-multiplier 1` (or any other value) flag to your `ExecStart=` command
3. Do `daemon-reload`:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```
4. Restart the `peggod` service
```bash
systemctl restart peggod
```

### Edit the multiplier
```bash
PEGGO_PROFIT_MULTIPLIER=1 # or any other value
sudo sed -i.bak -e "s/--profit-multiplier../--profit-multiplier=$PEGGO_PROFIT_MULTIPLIER/" /etc/systemd/system/peggod.service
```

## Sending transactions
### From Cosmos to ETH
Syntax:
```bash
umeed tx peggy send-to-eth [eth-dest-addr] [amount] [bridge-fee] [flags]
```
Example:
```bash
umeed tx peggy send-to-eth 0x05a64fE82628217900ced80Bf3747b5ef88BFa21 10000000uumee 1uumee --from validator --chain-id umee-alpha-mainnet-2
```
### From ETH to Cosmos
#### NB: `0xe54fbaecc50731afe54924c40dfd1274f718fe02` is ERC20 Umee token address
Syntax:
```bash
peggo bridge send-to-cosmos [token-address] [recipient] [amount] [flags]
```
Example:
```bash
peggo bridge send-to-cosmos 0xe54fbaecc50731afe54924c40dfd1274f718fe02 umee1qpuaz7q3qw0lnu9jng8xa5md6p3pg9zey5z875 1000000 --eth-pk=$ETH_PK_CLEAN --eth-rpc=$ETH_RPC
```
`$ETH_PK_CLEAN` - your private key from ETH wallet without `0x`

`$ETH_RPC` - your Goerli ETH endpoint (you can use `https://goerli-light.nodes.guru`)
